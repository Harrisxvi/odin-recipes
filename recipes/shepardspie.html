    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A british classic savoury dish, of cooked minced meat 
        topped with mashed & then baked potato.</p>
            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>500g Lamb Mince</li>
                    <li>900g potatoes, cut into chunks</li>
                    <li>2-3 Medium Carrots, chopped</li>
                    <li>1 Large, chopped onion</li>
                    <li>Worcestershire Sauce</li>
                    <li>85g Butter</li>
                    <li>3 tbsp Milk</li>
                    <li>500ml Beef Stock</li>
                </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 1 tbsp sunflower oil in a medium saucepan, 
                then soften 1 chopped onion and 2-3 chopped carrots for 
                a few mins.</li>
            <li>When soft, turn up the heat, crumble in 500g lamb mince and 
                brown, tipping off any excess fat.</li>
            <li>Add 2 tbsp tomato pur√©e and a large splash of Worcestershire
                 sauce, then fry for a few mins.</li>
            <li>Pour over 500ml beef stock, bring to a simmer, then cover and 
                cook for 40 mins, uncovering halfway.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat the oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4, then make the
                mash. Boil the 900g potato, cut into chunks, in salted water
                for 10-15 mins until tender. Drain, then mash with 85g butter
                and 3 tbsp milk.</li>
            <li>Put the mince into an ovenproof dish, top with the mash and 
                ruffle with a fork. The pie can now be chilled and frozen for
                 up to a month.</li>
            <li>Bake for 20-25 mins until the top is starting to colour and the
                 mince is bubbling through at the edges. (To bake from frozen, 
                cook at 160C/fan 140C/gas 3 for 1 hr-1 hr 20 mins until piping 
                hot in the centre).</li>
            <li>Leave to stand for 5 mins before serving.</li>
        </ol>
